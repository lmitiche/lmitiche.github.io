    	The tourism kiosk is an information kiosk meant for both non-residents and
		residents of Indianapolis. The purpose of the kiosk is to supply information on main attractions,
		events, recreational activities, and places to eat in the surrounding area. Users will be able to perform
		tasks such as making reservations for certain events, paying for parking/adding time, and finding out key information about attractions and events. <br><br> 
    	This user persona was created after interviewing a total of five students attending
    	different universities. The primary demographic was female and middle eastern between the ages of 19 and 30, all of whom are full time students
    	with a job. One of the main recurring values/goals observed was education and being successful. All of them 
   	 	personally own at least a mobile device and a laptop, making them well versed with technology.
   	 	Some of the main dislikes were unmotivated people, pessimists and large crowds. The user persona I created embodies 
   	 	most of these characteristics and lives on campus.

    <p class="nice">This wireframe takes a user through the task of booking a restaurant. A total of five screens are displayed, 
    beginning with the home screen and ending with the confirmation screen. Screen 2 displays the restaurant options filtered by proximity. The third screen displays
    restaurant details and booking information. Screen 4 is where a user enters their contact information to confirm the reservation and screen 5 is the 
    confirmation screen. <br> <a href ="https://whimsical.com/assignment-2-JZGaydzpGpnrGv9AmmmSDQ" target="_blank" style="color:#b8eaf5; ">Kisok Wireframe 1</a></p>
    
    <p class ="nice">This heuristic evaluation was conducted on the Personal and Business Car leasing website,
		LINGsCARS. This website is a car leasing website based in the U.K. Its purpose is to advertise
		its leasing business and inspire users to lease cars with their company. I used Nielsonâ€™s ten
		heuristics to perform this evaluation.

    <p class ="nice"> These are the results of the usability test for the toursim kiosk. The
    reason for the test is to measure the kiosk's success rate and find the strengths and weaknesses 
    in my initial design. Two of the participants were students ages 19 and 20 and were both familiar with
    online booking services. The third participant was 55 and has never reserved online before. I believe
    that because the testers ranged from experienced to inexperienced,it has helped generate better feedback.

    <p class = "nice"> This is the final UI of the tourism kiosk. The main changes made to the design 
    from the low fidelity wire frame are: the inclusion of the menu, the modification of the booking 
    and filter features, and the inclusion of back buttons on every page. <br>
