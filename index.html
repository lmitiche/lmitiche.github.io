<h2>A Little Bit About Me:</h2>

<p class ="green"> Hi, Iâ€™m Layla Mitiche. Currently, I am a junior at IUPUI majoring in Informatics and specializing in Human Computer Interaction and Applied Computer Science. I am fascinated by the psychological aspect of HCI and am particularly interested in user experience design work. I enjoy learning about ways in which we can facilitate human to computer interaction through user experience design work and how this can be applied to find solutions for current problems.
On the technical side, I do have experience in HTML/CSS and am familiar with SQL. 
Aside from school I have a strong passion for photography and traveling. I've been to Spain, France, Morocco and Algeria but that is just barely touching the tip of my list.
